Build software that can use sensors and Machine Learning to automatically identify the presence of
pests in rice fields and inform the farmer so that the farmer can make use of chemical and mechanical methods,
more specifically using ML-technologies .
• Used Tensorflow Frame Work and the Keras library to train our model.
• A CNN model is constructed using Keras that specifies the architecture and pooling layers.
• The model achieved close to 80 percentage during the testing phase.
• Tools Used:Python,CNN,Tensorflow,Keras
